## üöÄ Repositories
- [Repository 1](https://github.com/jlutrera/42Madrid-Pool): Projects made in the <42> pool.
- [Repository 2](https://github.com/jlutrera/libft): This project consists of programming a library in C. Your library will have a lot of general-purpose functions.
- [Repository 3](https://github.com/jlutrera/ft_printf): The goal of this project is to reprogram printf().
- [Repository 4](https://github.com/jlutrera/get_next_line): The goal of this project is to program a function that returns a line read from a file descriptor.
- [Repository 5](https://github.com/jlutrera/Born2beroot): This project is a systems administration exercise.
- [Repository 6](https://github.com/jlutrera/push_swap): This project sorts data in a stack, with a limited set of instructions, using the smallest number of instructions. To succeed, I must study various algorithms and choose the most appropriate one for optimal sorting.
- [Repository 7](https://github.com/jlutrera/minitalk): The purpose of this project is to create a small data exchange program using UNIX signals.
- [Repository 8](https://github.com/jlutrera/FdF): This project consists of creating a three-dimensional representation of a landscape with relief.
- [Repository 9](https://github.com/jlutrera/philosophers): In this project, we study the basic principles of threading a process. We learn how to create threads and explore mutexes.
- [Repository 10](https://github.com/jlutrera/minishell): The goal of this project is to create a simple shell.
- [Repository 11](https://github.com/jlutrera/miniRT): This project is an introduction to the world of Raytracing. With this project, simple CGI (computer-generated images) are rendered.
- [Repository 12](https://github.com/jlutrera/NetPractice): This project is a general exercise to help learn about networking.
- [Repository 13](https://github.com/jlutrera/CPP_00_04): C++ projects
- [Repository 14](https://github.com/jlutrera/CPP_05_09): C++ projects
- [Repository 15](https://github.com/jlutrera/Inception): This project is a System Administration related exercise.
- [Repository 16](https://github.com/jlutrera/webserv): This project is about writing your ow HTTP server. You will be able to test it with an actual browser.
- [Repository 17](https://github.com/jlutrera/ft_transcendence): This project is about creating a website for the mighty Pong contest!
- [Repository 18](https://github.com/jlutrera/computorv1): The program solves a polynomial third, second and lower degree equation. It shows the equation in its reduced form, the degree of the equation and it‚Äôs solution(s) and the polarity of the discriminant if it makes sens.
- [Repository 19](https://github.com/jlutrera/computorv2): The project is an instruction interpreter that, like a shell, retrieves user inputs for advanced computations. It will present the form of a simple command interpreter, and will have to be able to answer some specifications.
- [Repository 20](https://github.com/jlutrera/ft_linear_regression): It implement a simple linear regression with a single feature - in this case, the mileage of the car.
- [Repository 21](https://github.com/jlutrera/dslr): You will learn how to read a data set, to visualize it in different ways, to select and clean unnecessary information from your data. You will train a logistic regression that will solve classification problem.
